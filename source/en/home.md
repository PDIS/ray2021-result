      content: You and I can be part of the revamp of the websites of the public sector.<br>From the first edition of the RAY 1.0 government website inspection to the RAY 5.0 website revamp, we have continued to invite young students to participate in the process with their design and information expertise to create a better user experience for public sector websites and seek out more design possibilities for government websites. For this year's program, we have brought in 14 students from various colleges and universities with diverse backgrounds in service design, interface design, visual design and information engineering to partner with the National Development Council and related ministries to conduct a series of exchanges, research and design for four public sector websites.

      title: A combination of techniques for revamping the website
      content: "To ensure a consistent focus and clear results after testing, the PDIS team has put together “Six Design Steps” for user experience for the 2021 RAY program. At the outset of the program, PDIS held a briefing session to explain the six steps and the implementation schedule, and to ensure that the students had a good grasp of the interviews and research, so as to lay the groundwork for subsequent design and prototyping. These six design steps not only give students a clear picture of their own project progress, but also serve as a reference for future units."

      title: "\"Be proactive, get involved\""
      content: The revamping of digital services must continuously receive input from all sides and involve a wide range of actors in the design of the initiative, such as related ministries, relevant administrative units, and other stakeholders, so that the whole initiative is compatible with practical feasibility, reasonable business scope, and more design possibilities.<br>As a result, the students engaged in a number of workshops with ministry staff during the internship, gaining insight into the ideas of service providers through a range of design tools, while establishing an offline collaborative model and inviting the agencies to be involved in the design process on an ongoing basis to ensure progress and mutual communication.

      content: In order to ensure consistent work priorities and clear results after testing, the PDIS team has compiled the "Six Design Steps" for the user experience of the RAY project in 2021. At the beginning of the project, PDIS will hold an explanatory meeting to explain the six steps and implementation schedule, and to ensure that students have a certain degree of mastery of interviews and research to lay a foundation for the basic quality of subsequent design and prototype output. In addition to allowing students to clearly grasp the progress of their own projects, this six-step design can also be used as a reference for related units in the future.

    - title: 1. How to make the homepage have clear website features and let users operate without burden
      content: We found that the homepage information was messy and there was no obvious visual focus. From the GA data, we found that many people quickly left as soon as they entered the webpage.

    - title: 2. How to enable the public to directly understand the words, solve the problem of inconsistency between the operating interface and the public’s cognitive experience, and reduce the gap in expectations
      content: We found that the layout of web information is messy, and the words used do not match the experience of the public. Volunteers often spend a lot of time and effort in finding activities.

    - title: 3. How to solve the cumbersome search and registration process, let users complete the registration process on the same website, and let the Social Affairs Bureau clearly grasp the matchmaking list
      content: The existing registration process does not require registration through the website, and the public directly registers with the organization unit; this method does not have a unified data collection and collation, and the Social Bureau cannot grasp the registration status.

  title: Establish a two-way bridge to stimulate enthusiasm for participation
  content: "In version A, we tried to re-arrange the structure, optimize the process, and improve the smoothness of use; in version B, we tried to separate and highlight the story of the characters and stimulate users' enthusiasm for volunteering; in version C, we tried to combine A / B two Version features are integrated, coupled with the characteristics of two-way communication, with \"simplified process steps + warm exploration content + two-way bridge\" has become our final design direction."

  title: Exploring scenic spots through dialogue and assisting in easy itinerary planning
  content: For the A version of Wireframe, we designed messneger chatbot to operate on Taiwan Forest Recreation. Since Taiwan Forest Recreation has a wealth of information, we added a chatbot that can interact with users on the website after discussion. On the one hand, we extend the functionality of the website. , On the other hand, it allows users to get immediate assistance when entering the site, simplifying the complexity of using the site. The B version of Wireframe is designed to expand the service in the form of an official Line chatbot, which interactively assists users in selecting suitable attractions. In addition to linking the front, middle and back of the entire itinerary, it also plans to combine online and offline services to allow users to have a complete experience throughout the entire itinerary.

      content: "Taiwan Forest Recreation has undergone two major revisions and already has most of the functions that satisfy users.

    - title: Simplify the attraction information page, quickly understand the must-know information
      content: For the sake of complete information, Taiwan Forest Recreation puts all necessary information on the page as much as possible. And because of the small screen of the mobile phone, too much text will make users feel difficult, so we specially designed a simplified version of the attraction information page, and put the necessary information such as opening and closing of the park, business hours, etc., so that mobile phone users can quickly view the relevant News.

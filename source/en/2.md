  description: The National Health Insurance (NHI) Card Online Registration Service aims to provide more channels for people to access the various digital services offered by the National Health Insurance Administration (NHIA). A preliminary study found that some users got stuck in the registration process and eventually withdrew from registration. The team therefore worked with the NHIA to establish the goal of helping users to complete their registration while ensuring the security of their information.

  title: The best solution that combines creativity and feasibility
  content: CThere are certain processes and tips that should not be omitted given the concerns about information security. We therefore used the workshop format to merge the feasibility-focused version with the pie-in-the-sky version to ensure that we could troubleshoot technical snags encountered by users and improve their user experience of the new version of the site without compromising information security.

  subtitle: Peace of mind at every stage of your life
  description: The health insurance card online registration service is dedicated to providing people with more diversified channels to use various digital services promoted by the National Health Insurance Agency. Preliminary research found that some users will get stuck in the registration process and even give up registration in the end. Therefore, the team worked with the National Health Insurance Agency to establish goals, hoping to help users complete registration while ensuring information security.

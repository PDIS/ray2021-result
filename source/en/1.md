  subtitle: Linearly organize information and processes to maximize use efficiency
  description: "After interviews and usability tests, the team found that the current system information structure is not clear from the affinity diagram method, and the cost of collecting data for users is high, and it is impossible to quickly understand important information and make decisions; at the same time, users send out on the system The behavior of erroneous data increases the processing cost of the back-end of the system. The team improved these problems, reorganized the system architecture, and designed a linear \"depth-oriented\" user process. The ultimate goal is to help users \"understand public trust\", \"choose public trust\" and \"apply for public trust\" more effectively."
